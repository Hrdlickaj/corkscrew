# Corkscrew

Corkscrew is an approachable app designed to help wine drinkers document their tasting journey and pinpoint their personal preferences. With a fun, colorful interface, an emphasis is placed on trying new things and remembering not only the details of a wine, but the moments spent enjoying it.

# Functionality
Users can create/log into a password-protected account, document details of the wines they drink using an editable form (including uploading an image of the label, recording basic information such as the wine's vintage, and adding a rich-text tasting note and a memory of when they had the wine), view a filterable list of all of their wines, edit select details of their wines or remove them permanently from their list, and view a map showing the terroirs they've tasted.
